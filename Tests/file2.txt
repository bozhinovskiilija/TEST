        An explanation of different odds types
        When using the auction you will see different types of Odds displayed in different areas of the site. Some of them will be familiar to you and some you won’t have come across before these may be confusing at first but when you learn the how they work they will be become an invaluable tool for getting the most from your auction experience.
        Placed OddsThe odds on a bet at the time it was placed.
        Market Odds  The current market odds the bookmaker is providing.
        Bid Odds™  An odds format to enable you to compare the current bid and return against current market odds.  Use it as a guide to establish if the auction is delivering better odds than the current market.
        Auction Odds™  Where Bid Odds™ will always change when the bid changes  Auction Odds™  are set and established by the final bid amount paid for a listing they give you a comparison for the auction versus the market.
        An odds example - If odds are 10/1 and you place a £10 bet – the potential return is £110 (odds times the stake plus the stake back).
        This is calculated by using the odds (10/1 = 10) times the stake (10) = 10 x 10 = £100 plus £10 stake
        If we know the return = £110 and we know the high bid (£10) then we can work out the odds to deliver this return.
        In this case if £10 was the highest bid, and that bid was successful there would be £0.50 cost (5%fee) taking the total to £10.50.
        To derive the Bid odds so that they can be compared to current market – the return of the existing bet you are bidding is still £110, less the ‘cost’ = £10.50 so the bid odds (for comparison) would be £110-£10.50 = £99.50.  £99.50 divided by bid cost (10.50), bid odds = 9.5/1.
        In summary Bid odds are a measurement to enable you to compare the current bid and return against current market odds.  Use it as a guide to establish if the auction is delivering better odds than the current market. The bid odds will always show the bid price including the fee cost for the bidder so that a total cost comparison can be made against the market odds for these bidding viewers.

					  Below this are boxes to set a Buy it Now price and a Reserve price for your listing both are optional and you can still list even if you chose not to include these prices.

					  A Buy it Now price will allow your listing to be bought outright for this price at any time during the auction meaning this bet has been sold, is no longer yours and the auction is over.

					  A Reserve price is really just the minimum sale price your willing to except for your bet. This ensures that the bet will not be sold for less than that amount even if there are bids made on the bet.
					  You can edit your reserve price at any time as long as there are no bids at or below your new reserve price, you may wish to do this to encourage more bids for your listing. If the bet gets to the end of the auction and your Reserve price has not been met the bet is still yours. At this point if the event you’ve bet on is still to happen or In-play you can list the bet again.
